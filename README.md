This is intended to be a rework of WinAmp to strip out all of the bloatware features that I never wanted or needed and return it back closer to a WinAmp 3 type of app. I use WinAmp mostly for the input plugins, its ease of use and nostalgia. Ultimately I plan to make this a lightweight version that I can use on my machines without having to go through the bullshit that was added after the AOL acquisition among other things.
